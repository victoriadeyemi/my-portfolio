# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio


I am an innovative data-driven designer, inspired by empathy for users pain and needs; with an in-depth understanding of UX principles and methodologies, and its influence on business fulfillment; I lead projects from initial briefing to launch day and beyond, with direct responsibility for the day-to-day management of high quality user-centred content and workflow using relevant design applications.

As a creative problem solver, thrilled by learning new things and open-minded to criticism and growth. Having a genuine interest in people, I love to work tenaciously with others for team excellence and development. My excellent interpersonal and communication skills has continued to facilitate relationships whilst strategically working with product and service teams; this ensures that I translate the business language to plain English, bridging the gap between corporate service needs and user needs and experiences.

I have experience using analytics, user feedback, and user research to evaluate and improve user experience. I am adept at creating clear, seamless user experience and publishing interactive content; and I would love to work with you.
